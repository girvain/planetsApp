# How would I improve this?
- Add a "next page" button to pull the next data page on screen.
- Create a single screen display (PDP) for each resident or movie to show more details for a single data item.
- Display an error message on screen when network call actually fails.
- add offline saving and restoring of the resident and film data thats fetched secondary to the planet data.
- Possibly add a timestamp to decide if enough time has passed to reduce filesystem access to saving the request data.
- add integration testing for the file system persistance.
